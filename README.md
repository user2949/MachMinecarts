# Description
This datapack, as it's name suggests too, makes Minecarts pretty much the speed of sound, and it's way faster than a normal **"/gamerule minecartMaxSpeed 1000"**, this can go around 408 blocks/second, or around 1.468 million blocks per second, if you pair this data-pack with Distant Horizons, A really really long minecart rail, and a fast computer, you can get the full experience of this data-pack, as in the following video, since the speed is 408 m/s and the speed of sound is 343 m/s on average, we can calculate that it is exactly mach 1.189504373177843.

# Bugs and Problems
Although everything might seem cool, there is a bunch of bugs, here are the following :
- If you use this data-pack on a PaperMC server or anything that is forked off of it, will cause a bunch of problems for the player, since the Minecart goes so fast, the server thinks they are cheating, even though it's not supposed to do that, although you can bypass that.
- If there is a block infront of the Minecart even where the Minecart is supposed to stop, it will not stop immediately only if the Minecart is going full speed, and if it does touch the block, it will go through the block.
- Curves, due to minecraft's math for clamping curves, this math absolutely breaks down if you are going Mach 1 in Minecarts, and you can tell by that because you litteraly curve around 16 - 32 blocks before the curve, because the speed calculation is way too fast

# Performance Issues
This is a major part of the data-pack, if you do not have a strong enough computer to load the chunks, even if it's already preloaded, it will pretty much just teleport you to each chunk because you are going way too fast and your computer is way behind to load the chunks back after it's preloaded, you can check it with the video if you see closely. If you want the full experience, you need to get a **new computer**

# Video
If you want to see the data-pack in action, you can see the following, it runs in 1.20.1, way before 24w33a where the **"/gamerule minecartMaxSpeed"** was added
